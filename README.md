A weather app that pulls from the OpenWeatherMap API to allow users to search for and view the weather in cities worldwide. Built with nodejs and Express.

Let's talk about the application; Our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this, an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18¬∞C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky/ICON), and then the user's city and country (London, GB).

The API provider is [http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org](http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org)
